- Worked in a virtual architecture instead of pushing to GitHub as some of the project members were more familiar with that than the latter. 
	- resulted in one big push at the end of the project deadline 

Challenges: Being able to be on the same page for frameworks and catering to everyone's specialties
	- divided the work to be able to maximize efficiency to successfully synchronize everyone's skills
		- one full stack, two backend, two frontend

- Challenged ourselves and added our own OAuth instead of a third party, as it felt more appropriate to be able to create a login for our own website rather than another one
	 - possibly spent too much time doing this, drifting away from an opportunity to spend more time cleaning up the UI
