User Story: Text Cards
Other than the map presented after login, users will be able to pull up text/content cards that may assist in organizing a trip with activities that interest them along the way. These cards will display information much like what a google search would bring up: information, hours, reviews, etc. The card would have the following properties: 


Pulls up a card with map in the background:
* Rather than bringing the user to a new tab/site, a card that fills up a large portion of the center of the site will be shown
* No errors from client side, need smoothness in front-end UI 
Information on the card:
* Price range, reviews, address, hours, and all of the essentials for a trip would be shown 
* Since this would be pulled from an API, as long as the routes are established it should not cause any errors
Buttons:
* Users will be presented with buttons that allow them to click “X” or “O” (something along those lines) to either disregard the card or add that location to their trip
* There will also be an “X” to close out the card without choosing on the upper-right hand, in case user wants to revisit
