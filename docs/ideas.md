Idea: Itinerary generator

Description: a tool for travel-enthusiasts that would ask for the user’s interests, preferences, trip duration, no. of people they are travelling with, budget, etc. and devise an itinerary based on those parameters that would best fit the user’s travel needs.

Idea 2: Top Spotify artists' concerts around you 

A web-app that allows users to connect via Spotify to output the concert dates of top artists around the location of the user. The price and availability of the tickets for the concert will also be shown. If no artists are shown, users are prompted concerts for artists that are similar to who they listen to and might enjoy. Users can access this app whenever they would like to plan a trip to a concert, conveniently showing concerts for music that they frequently listen to.
