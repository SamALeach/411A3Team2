User Story: Entering in data


After the user logs in/signs up (refer to account creation/login user story), they will be asked to fill and submit a form describing their preferences and necessary details about their trip. The form would consist of the following parameters:


Location
* The name of the city/town/place that the person is in/wants to visit. 
* Would select from a drop-down list of places to choose from, and if they type in something that is not on the list, it won’t let them select it or move forward. 

Trip duration and dates
* Would ask the user to input the dates they are gonna be at that location for.
* The user would select from a calendar drop down the dates and and also the tentative times, so that the app knows how many full days they are going to be in a particular place for. 
* Since the selection of dates is going to be from a drop-down menu, format being wrong wouldn’t be a possibility. For the times, they input a whole number (no half hours or quarters or any other fractions) in a 12 hour format. 

Number of people travelling
* The user would be asked to input the number of people in their travel party, in the “x number of adults and y number of children below the age of 12” format. 
* Would only be allowed to enter numerical numbers upto a certain maximum number (maybe around 50), no decimals, strings, other formats would be allowed. 

Preferences
* Would present the user with a list of options they can choose from, pertaining to what they could do in that particular city. Examples: theme parks, historical places, theatres, beaches, religious places, etc. The user selects upto 5 options.
* Since preferences are going to be selected from a list, format being wrong wouldn’t be a possibility. Once they have selected 5 options, all other options would be “greyed out”, so they can’t select more.
